# Password Manager
## Overview
Password manager provides a simple and portable JavaSwing application that stores your passwords using a symmetric DES encryption. Multiple master accounts can be made, meaning you will be prompted to enter a unique login in order to decrypt and access your saved passwords.

## Usage
### Login Screen
The package can be placed anywhere on your computer after extraction, however, it is recommended that you place it in its own folder, as the program directly interacts with your file system in order to create user accounts and temporary files.

Upon first run of the program, please be sure to create a new user by typing in a memorable but secure master username and password, then clicking "New User".

Afterwards, you will be able to see your username appear in your folder. At this point, you can click login with the already filled in information.

### User Screen
In the user screen, you can choose between "Add/Modify", and "Delete". The former will create a new entry for your user, while the latter will attempt to search and remove the entry with the entry name you have specified.

Once you have completed your operations, be sure to click the "x" on the top bar of the window to logout and reencrypt your files.
